# â™˜ Knight's Tour on a 5Ã—5 Chessboard â€“ C Project

This project is written in **C** and explores the classic **Knight's Tour problem** on a 5Ã—5 chessboard. The user provides a starting position, and the program determines if there exists a tour that covers every square exactly once â€” without revisiting any position.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

- Accept a user-defined starting position on a 5Ã—5 chessboard.
- Search for a **valid Knightâ€™s Tour** that:
  - Visits every square **exactly once**
  - **Does not** repeat any square
- Output whether such a tour exists from the given starting point.

## â™Ÿ About the Knight's Tour

A Knight's Tour is a sequence of moves of a knight on a chessboard such that the knight visits every square exactly once. This classic problem is often used in algorithms, backtracking, and recursion exercises.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- **C Programming Language**
- Recursive backtracking algorithm
- Standard I/O for user interaction

## ðŸ“š Key Learnings

- Practiced recursion and backtracking
- Reinforced 2D array manipulation and coordinate handling in C
- Learned how to apply classic algorithmic problems in low-level programming

Feel free to test different starting positions and explore the logic behind knight movements on constrained boards!
